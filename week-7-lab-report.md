# Part 2: 

  The first option took about a 70 seconds because it was relatively slow to scp into the server but still very fast.
  
  The second option took about 40 seconds seconds since I could just ssh into the server, open the vim, and then do the very fast edits from part 1.
  
  1) I think that I prefer the second option because then I do not have to move the file and open it on VSCode, 
  and instead make those edits very quickly without downloading anything.
  
  2) However, if the project were already on my computer, I would prefer to just edit it in VSCode. Using VIM might take longer since 
  I won't always know the shortest way to make the changes I want and it is simpler to select and delete and change things in VSCode.
